# Lab9-ControlUnit

This file contains the control unit for our RISC-V processor. The inputs and outputs align with the output and inputs of the datapath portion of the processor.

The control unit is meant to change the inputs of the datapath based on the instruction type. The type can be determined by using 2 of the func3 bits and 2 of the opcode bits for each instruction.
